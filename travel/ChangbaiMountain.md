# 长白山


“I plan to visit Changbai Mountain in October to see the Tianchi Lake. Which slope is the best to explore: the north, west, or south?”这是这句话的英文翻译。不过你准备十月份去长白山的话，需要穿厚一点的衣服哦，山上的气温比较低。

Make it persuasive

In October, I'm looking forward to visiting Changbai Mountain to witness the breathtaking beauty of Tianchi Lake.

Make it assertive：

I will be visiting Changbai Mountain in October to see the Tianchi Lake.
