An accessibility feature designed to ease eye strain, 

especially in dim lighting or for those sensitive to bright or blue light.

一项旨在缓解眼睛疲劳的辅助功能，尤其是在昏暗的灯光下或对明亮或蓝光敏感的人。

By filtering out blue and green light, this mode gives the screen a reddish tint, 

which is less likely to disrupt sleep patterns and is gentler on the eyes.

通过过滤蓝光和绿光，此模式使屏幕呈现微红色调，不太可能扰乱睡眠模式并且对眼睛更温和。
